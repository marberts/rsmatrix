## Changes in version 0.2.5

- Updated to work with Matrix >= 1.4-2.

## Changes in version 0.2.3

- Making the "Y" vector with rs_matrix() no longer gives an error with length-0 inputs and a factor with non-empty levels.

- rs_matrix() cleans up the enclosing environment of its result.

## Changes in version 0.2.1

- rs_pairs() and rs_matrix() are now faster, and less picky about their inputs for time periods.

## Changes in version 0.2.0

- rs_pairs() has been reworked to be much faster and more general, while rs_unpair() has been removed. These changes are not backwards compatible.

- Added French translations.

- Fixed the NOTE about LazyData from CRAN.
